					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Web Design Decal Website </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/existingWDDwireframe.jpg"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> Web Design Decal Website Redesign </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/redesignWDDwireframe.jpg"/>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to communicate the purpose and logistics of the DeCal to students at UC Berkeley. The design itself acts as an example of work that could come out of taking this student-led class. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> My redesign addressed the principles of size as more important text were bigger in size than others. Additionally, repetition in the example images of website design allow for the auidence to get a better idea of different website design examples in a well alligned structure. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
